      <description>I work at DataCamp as a Data Scientist on the growth team. Previously, I was a Data Analyst at Etsy working with their search team to design, implement, and analyze experiments on the ranking algorithm, UI changes, and new features. In summer 2016, I completed Metis&amp;rsquo;s three-month, full-time Data Science Bootcamp, where I did several data science projects, ranging from using random forests to predict successful projects on DonorsChoose.org to building an application in R Shiny that helps data science freelancers find their best-fit jobs.</description>
