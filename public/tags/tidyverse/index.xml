      <description>I recently completed Colin Fay’s excellent Intermediate Functional Programming with purrr course (full disclosure: I work at DataCamp, where the course is hosted). Although I’ve used purrr before, there were a lot of functions that were either new to me or I hadn’t realized the first use of.
purrr is a library for functional programming in R. If you’re familiar with purrr, it’s probably because of the map() function. If you’ve seen purrr but been scared off, I’m right there with you.</description>

      <description>In early 2018, I gave a few conference talks on “The Lesser Known Stars of the Tidyverse.” I focused on some packages and functions that aren’t as well known as the core parts of ggplot2 and dplyr but are very helpful in exploratory analysis. I walked through an example analysis of Kaggle’s 2017 State of Data Science and Machine Learning Survey to show how I would use these functions in an exploratory analysis.</description>
